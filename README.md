# PigLatin+

A rewrite of the PigLatin translator tool that I had to make for my 2024 Cert III general IT course.
I have a few goals (all of them being gimicks ofcourse) to make this better then the original version.
And I'm writing it in rust, because rust is a language I've been intrested in for quite a while now.

## To-Do List

- [ ] Create base PigLatin translator
- [ ] Translate full strings
- [ ] Read and write too files
- [ ] Config
- [ ] Y checking (ceck rule 3 [here](https://www.getblend.com/blog/how-to-speak-pig-latin/) for context)
- [ ] Decent looking user interface, a challenge that my teacher actually suggested
